\section{Introduction}

In the paper \cite{geraci2017operating}, authors proposed to operate massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) cellular Base Stations (BSs) in unlicensed bands (mMIMO-U). they design a procedures required at a cellular BS to guarantee coexistence with nearby WiFi stations in the same piece of unlicensed band via interference alignment technology.  Fig.~\ref{FIG:mMIMO} show the flow of mMIMO-U  proposed.

\section{System Model}

  WE consider the downlink of a cellular network where  massive MIMO cellular BSs are deployed to operate in the unlicensed band in a synchronous manner, and communicate with their respective sets of connected cellular UEs, while WiFi devices also operate in the same unlicensed band.  Each BSs equipped with  a larger number of antennas $N$, and  simultaneously serves K UEs. Each BS transmit with power $P_{b}$. On the WiFi side, $L$ is denoted by the set of WiFi devices. We assume that all WiFi device transmit with power $P_{w}$.  It worth nothing that both UEs and WiFi devices are equipped with one antenna. The  signal which  UE $k$ in cell $i$  received can  be expressed by 
 \begin{equation}\label{EQU:ChannelModel}
    \begin{aligned}
        y_{(i,k)}[m] = & \sqrt{P_{b}}h_{[i,(i,k)]}w_{(i,k)}s_{(i,k)}[m] + \sqrt{P_{b}}\sum_{k'\in{}K_{i}\backslash{}k}h_{[i,(i,k)]}w_{(i,k')}s_{(i,k')}[m] +  \\ & \sqrt{P_{b}}\sum_{i'\in{}J\backslash{}k}h_{[i',(i,k)]}w_{(i',k)}s_{(i',k)}[m] +    \sqrt{P_{w}}\sum_{l\in{}L}g_{[l,(i,k)]}s_{(l)}[m]  +  \eta[m]
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $h_{[i,(j,k)]} \in{}C^{1\times{}N}$ is denoted as the channel vector between BS $i$ and UE $k$ in cell$j$.  $g_{[l,(j,k)]} \in{}C$ is denoted as the channel coefficient  between WiFi device $l$ and UE  $k$ in cell $j$. 
\subsection{WiFi Channel Estimation}
In this phase, all the BSs remain silent, and thus each BSs $i$  receives the signal from WiFi devices. We can obtain the interference by estimation:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        & z_{i}[m] = \sum_{l\in{}L} \sqrt{P_{l}}g_{i,l}s_{l} + \eta_{i}[m] \\
        & Z_{i} = \frac{1}{M_{c}}\sum_{m=1}^{M_{c}} z_{i}[m]z_{i}^{\dag}[m],
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
which consists of all transmission form active WiFi devices and noise term  is ADWN. The $M_{c}$ is the length symbol intervals BS keep silent. $g_{i,l}\in{}C^{N\times{}1}$ is denoted as the channel vector between  BS $i$ and WiFi $l$.
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        & Z_{i} = U_{i}\Lambda_{i}U^{\dag}_{i},
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\Lambda = diag(\lambda_{i,1},,,\lambda_{i,N})$, such that $\lambda_{i,1}>\lambda_{i,1},,,>\lambda_{i,N})$.  In order to  allocate dof, let define the matrix
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        \Sigma_{i} = [u_{i,1},,,u_{i,D_{i}}],
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
whose columns contain the $D_{i}$ dominant eigenvectors of $Z_{i}$. For a sufficiently large $D_{i}$, $range\{\Sigma_{i}\}$ represents the channel subspace on which BSs $i$ receives most of the WiFi transmitted power. Therefore, the power transmitted by BS $i$  on $range\{\Sigma_{i}\}$ represents the major source of the interference for one or more WiFi devices.

\section{My Question}
It is well known that WiFi applied Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) protocol which channel will be occupied by only one  device in one time slot.  Therefore it is ineffective that this method  estimate channel state information from neighboring WiFi device. Let us consider this case, there is a WiFi  device  active with few time. On the hand, this estimation method will not guard this WiFi signal space. On the other hand, the estimation from major WiFi devices will be inaccurate due to  WiFi device $w$. 

\section{My plan}
Some  simulations may be need for verifying my idea.
